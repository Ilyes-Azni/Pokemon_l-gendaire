# Pokemon_l√©gendaire

Hi, in this repo I'll upload a rpject I've been working on lately. The name is in french but it means, legendary pokemon. As the name intends, the aim of the project is to create a model that can tell, wether a pokemon is legendary or not. The first upload (in the first branch) is the jupyter notebook of the model creation. There's a lot of cool feature engineering stuff that was fun to do. I ended the ipynb with a pickle file that I'll later on deploy on a webapp with streamlit which I hope you'll be able to test!

thanks :)
